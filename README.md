# The-volatility-forecasting-package
The relevance of financial volatility forecasting in efficient decision making regarding risk-related assets cannot be subdued. In the financial world, asset price volatility plays a pivotal role in investment decision making and portfolio setups. The prediction of these volatilities usually deal with noisy and non-stationary data bearing heteroscedastic nature. This package allows recourse to algorithms through a user friendly interface supported by the MathematicaÂ® framework, that provides easy access to models for high and low frequency data, while accessibly generating forecasts, estimating errors and generating plots. The package also allows analysis of user data and based on the results, a set of models appropriate for the data is suggested for eventual use.
